Just how crazy can I get w/ Markdown data munching in 11ty?

Inspired by [this StackOverflow comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64667959/how-to-create-dynamic-lists-in-11ty-static-site-generator#comment114432197_64684504) in response to my initial explanation of how [11ty data models inherently differ from Drupal ones](https://katiekodes.com/drupal-11ty/).

[See it on Netlify](https://11ty-markdown-kitties-puppies.netlify.app/)

Or [deploy it yourself](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/kkgthb/web-site-11ty-05-markdown-pets)
